# Statistical models
statistical models mentioned in the book are AR, MA, ARIMA and VAR

- AR and MA models are implemented here 
- ARIIMA(p, d, q) fits both AR(p) and MA(q) models to time series integrated d times
- VAR model is essentially AR model but coefficients are calculated simultaneously for multiple time series,
 so each point is now n-dimensional vector and each coefficient is n x n dimensional matrix
