More detailed explanations can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras). Important feature (in terms of understanding Keras code) is that Keras doesn't need input shape of NN to be specified, it can be determined during runtime, so usually Input layer is omitted.\n",

    "Similarly to how simple RNNs, LSTMs are built from cells. Here cell structure is a little more complicated — each cell has 3 inputs and 2 outputs. Outputs of each cell are:\n",
    "- $c$ - called \"state\", because it transports data between timesteps, while undergoing little modification at each timestep, which allows for capturing long time dependencies (also called \"Long Term Memory\")\n",
    "- $h$ - being output of given cell. It is modified at every step depending on $c$, previous timestep's output and current input, which allows for capturing short time dependencies (also called \"Short Term Memory\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs for each cell are $h$ and $c$ from previous cell and $x$ at given timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this 2 tensors $h$, $c$ passed between timesteps allows this architecture to learn both long and short term dependecies in data - that's why it's called Long Short Term Memory.\n",

    "- forget gate responsible for selecting which elements of state passed from previous timestep will be forgotten and which will be used to produce output and passed to next timestep\n",
    "- input gate responsible for updating state\n",
    "- output gate responsible for deciding how state will affect output and producing it\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Forget gate is single neural network that on given timestep $t$, based on $h_{t-1}$, $x_t$ and weights $w_f$ produces vector $f$. Sigmoid is used as activation function, so $f$ elements $\\in <0, 1>$. $f$ is multiplied element-wise with state $c_{t-1}$ - this operation decides which elements of $c_{t-1}$ will be forgotten.\n",
    "- Input gate consists of 2 neural networks, both taking $h_{t-1}$, $x_t$ as input.\n",
    "    - First one produces candidate state $C$ based on $W_c$ set of weights. It uses tanh activation function (since $c$ elements $\\in <-1; 1>$)\n",
    "    - Second one is responsible for deciding how candidate state $C$ will affect state $c$ passed to next step and used to produce output. Based on weights $W_i$ it produces tensor $i$, which elements $\\in <0; 1>$ because sigmoid activation is used.\n",
    "    - Outputs of these networks are multiplied with each other element-wise and then added to $c_{t-1} \\cdot f$ (produced by forget gate) in order to produce state $c_t$. \n",
    "- Output gate consists of single neural network, with sigmoid activation, which decides how state $c_t$ will affect output $h_t$. Based on weights $w_o$ it produces $o$ vector, which is multilpied element-wise with $tanh(c_t)$ in order to produce output $h_t$. $tanh$ is used here to squeeze $c$ to $<-1; 1>$.\n",

With RNNs we can predict multiple timesteps ahead, but it's done by running multiple timesteps with predictions as inputs to next timesteps, but we can't explicitly teach the model to predict $n$ timesteps ahead. The main idea behind autoencoders it to create 2 separate networks : \n",

    "Encoder-decoder architecture is derived from seq2seq problems like translation, where during training decoder input at timestamp $t$ is set to correct translated value of previous timestep $y_{t-1}$ - setting inputs to decoder in such way is called teacher forcing. In time series prediction tasks, teacher forcing isn't ideal way to teach decoder, since usually time series value at $t$ is highly correlated with value at $t-1$, so decoder learns to make predictions based on previous value (which during inference will be predicted value of previous timestep, not true one) instead of context vector. This leaves us with 2 possible ways of setting decoder inputs during training - either to 0 or to elements of context vector.\n",

Here input timesteps number will be set to 5 in order to better ilustrate layer output dimensions and output timesteps will be set to 2, to simplify code (for arbitrary number of outputs custom layer would need to be defined, here we'll just use RepeatVector to serve as decoder inputs at each timestep)."

Let's put our weights in vector $a$ of size $size(x)$ x $size(y)$, so for each element of $x$ each element of $y$ has some weight Now let's write it down mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "$a_{i, j} = attention(x_i, y_j)$, where $attention$ is function telling us how similar it's arguments are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way of telling how similar two numbers are is multiplying them, so in the simplest case $a$ could be calculated as a dot product of $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$a = x \\cdot y $\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: attention function can be also more complicated - for example modeled by neural network. Attention computed as dot product is called \"Luong attention\"*\n",

    "\n",
    "### But why is it called attention ?\n",
    "Calling it attention originates from where the concept is used. It was developed as a way to give decoder (in encoder-decoder architecture discussed earlier) a way to have access to all hidden states of encoder instead of just final one passed as context vector. If at each step of decoder we calculate attention score between it's state at this timestep and all encoder hidden states we can get information on which timesteps of encoder have the most influence on prediction that should be produced by decoder - in other words we get information to which encoder states decoder should pay the most ***attention***.\n",

    "For $q_1$ attention scores would be relatively similar for all values since all of the motorcycles, cars and airplanes have engines, but for $q_2$, $v_2 = $ \"www.cars.com\" would definitely have the highest score, so our attention scores might look like:\n",

In order to do that, attention layer needs to be created. Attention layer is implementation of concept described in previous paragraph - it takes query and value, then calculates attention scores between them. Then it multiplies attention by values vector, producing a matrix where for each query element it's corresponding attention vector contains value elements scaled by attention scores. If attention layer decided to pay low attention to given element$^{\\bf*}$, it will be scaled down, otherwise it will remain close to it's original value.\n",

    "Transformers are based on encoder-decoder architecture with attention, but swap out LSTMs with attention-based mechanism. This enables Transformers to overcome disadvantages of Recurrent Neural Networks, caused by their sequential nature:\n",
    "- impossibility of parallelizing calculations - processing of timestep $t_n$ can be started only after timestep $t_{n-1}$ is already processed\n",
    "-  limited possibility to capture long-term dependencies - autoencoder with attention that is based on LSTMs calculates single hidden state that is passed to decoder along with attention vector (which itself is based on hidden states), so long-term dependencies in data have significant possibility of being lost when dealing with long sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfmers eliminate these downsides by calculating attention-based encoded values for each timestep (so each timestep can be processed independently of others) and then passing it to decoder using more complicated attention mechanism that better captures long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer architecture\n",
    "Both encoder and decoder start with 2 common building blocks: \n",
    "- Component that processes input by creating embedding and capturing temporal relationships between input elements **(1)**\n",
    "- Attention-based component that swaps out LSTMs from previously described autoencoder architecture and works by calculating attention with input vector passed as key as well as query (self attention) **(2)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder also incorporates dense layer before passing data to decoder. **(3)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoder combines it's current output with context passed from encoder using multi-head attention mechanism **(4)** and passes it through dense layer before outputting prediction **(5)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Transformer architecture diagram](./images/attn_is_all.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both encoder and decoder might consist of multiple layers, where layer $n$ takes output of layer $n-1$ as input. Diagram below shows how transformer with 4 layers of encoder and decoder looks like.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next paragraphs will describe core concepts necessary to fully understand Transformers, then each component will be described in detail and finally simple implementation will be provided.\n",
    "### Core concepts\n",
    "**Note:** In order for all the math to work out, all inputs and outputs should have the same dimensionality - it's called $d_{model}$. For example if input layer outputs 10-element vector, then also encoder and decoder should output 10-element vectors, so $d_{model} = 10 $\n",
    "#### Linear transformation / layer\n",
    "Linear layer is used within all attention-based mechanisms here, so just to clarify - applying linear transformations to $x$ means multiplying $x$ by some learnable weight matrix $w$, so $linear\\_layer(x) = x \\cdot w$. Or in other words - linear layer is just a dense layer, but without activation function.\n",
    "#### Postional encoding\n",
    "Layers used throughout the Transformer architecture see their input as a set of vectors, with no order, since it does not incorporate any kind of recurrence or convolution, so we need a way to gain insight into how data points are related in time domain. Positional encoding provides that ability by adding encoded position value to embeddings before passing it as input to encoder/decoder. If we were to use simplest possible way to encode position we would use $encoding(x_i)=i$. Here we are going to use a little more complicated function (that does not increase with $i$ and is periodic, so model has better chance of grasping relative dependencies between timestamps). Exact function will be stated when implementing input layer, but general concept is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input for positional encoding layer will be $n_{timesteps}$ x $d_{model}$, we want to add encoded position for each timestep, so single encoding (for $i$-th timestep) should be vector with $d_{model}$ elements. The idea is to create $d_{model}$ sine/cosine functions, each with different frequency and calculate vector where element at each position is value of $sin(i)$/$cos(i)$ with corresponding frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we used frequencies $f = [2\\pi, 4\\pi, ... , 2 \\cdot d_{model} \\cdot \\pi] $ positional embeddings for timestep $i$ would be $pe = [sin(i, frequency=2\\pi), sin(i, frequency=4\\pi), ..., sin(i, frequency=2 \\cdot d_{model} \\cdot \\pi)]$ or we can acheive the same thing by rewriting $pe$ as $[sin(\\frac{i}{2\\pi}), sin(\\frac{i}{4\\pi}), ..., sin(\\frac{i}{2 \\cdot d_{model} \\cdot \\pi})]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example above pretty much states how positional encoding works. Only difference from real algorithm is that alternating sin and cos should be used -  $pe = [sin(\\frac{i}{2\\pi}), cos(\\frac{i}{4\\pi}), ..., sin(\\frac{i}{2 \\cdot (d_{model} - 1) \\cdot \\pi}), cos(\\frac{i}{2 \\cdot d_{model} \\cdot \\pi})]$\n",

    "- **Masked self attention** that works by passing the same vector (after linear transformation) as Key, Query and Value to the attention layer. Self attention layer essentially calculates how related are elements of given vector (something like autocorrelation). Masked part comes from the fact, that when decoding not all attention scores should be considered in order to avoid lookahead (at timestep $n$ only scores for timesteps $< n$ should be calculated, attention scores for timesteps $> n$ should be set to 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Masked attention diagram](./images/obraz_2023-09-27_185212952.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mulit-head attention** that is just a fancy name for calculating multiple attention vectors using different parameters for the same Query, Key and Value, then concatenating them and passing through linear layer. Also all Queries, Keys and Values are passed through different linear layer before entering one of attention layers. Each attention layer is called attention head. Multi-head attention layer's output is calculated as\n",
    "$ MultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concatenate(head_1, ..., head_h) $, where $ head_i = Attention (Q \\cdot W_i^Q, K \\cdot W_i^K, V \\cdot W_i^V) $ and \n",
    "$W_i^Q, W_i^K, W_i^V$ are weight matrices of size $d_{model}$ x $d_{weights}$, where size of $d_{weights}$ is $\\frac{d_{model}}{h}$, because after concatenating output of all heads, output of multi-head attention layer must be of size $d_{model}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Residual connections and normalization\n",
    "Since model is quite complicated, a few concepts need to be applied for it to work properly. Each sublayer of the model (Feed-forward and attention layers) needs to be \"wrapped\" into set of 2 operations:\n",
    "1. Residual connection - that for each sublayer that takes input $x$ does simple operation of adding layer's input to it's output $Residual(x, sublayer) = sublayer(x) + x$. This operation creates way for input data to still be represented in output of sublayer, so sublayer only has to take care of it's assigned task (without need to preserve \"memory\"). In diagrams residual connections are represented as \"loops\" around given layer.\n",
    "![Residual connection](./images/residual.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Layer normalization - After adding each sublayer's output via residual connection, final output needs to be normalized. It is done by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Architecture of components\n",
    "#### Input layers (embedding + positional encoding)\n",
    "Input layer is the same for encoder and decoder. It consists of 2 sublayers: embedding and positional encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Embedding***\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of NLP embedding layer would convert input tokens to vectors, but here (since we are woriking on continous time series data) we'll use dense layer in order to transform input data into vector of size $d_{model}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Positinal Encoding***\n",
    "\n",
    "As defined earlier, our goal is to create layer that adds values of certain sine/cosine functions to outputs of embedding layer in order to inject temporal information into our model. When implementing positional encoding operation, following formula will be used:\n",
