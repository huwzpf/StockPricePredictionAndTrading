    "\n",
    "Time Series are **random processes**, they have **non-deterministic** nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Joint distribution` is 2 or more distributions combined. \n",
    "- For example *P1 = P(y<sub>t</sub> = 2, y<sub>t+1</sub> =3)*\n",
    "\n",
    "`Strong distribution` is when **joint distribution** of time series remains unchanged over time.\n",
    "- For example, taking some joint distributions *P1, P2, P3* it should be true that *P1=P2=P3*. It should be true for **all** data points\n",
    "\n",
    "`Weak Stationary` is when **mean** of time series remains unchanged over time, **variance** and **autocovariance** stays the same as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autocovariance** depends only on time so for all given delta t **Autocovariance** of y<sub>t</sub> and y<sub>t-delta</sub> are **equal**. It is special type of covariance because two series come from same series, hence name **autocovariance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "All **strong stationary** are also **weak stationary** but not the other way around.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weak Stationary** is most likely to be found in real life scenarios.\n",

    "## Auto Correlaction Function in Time Seriess Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "`ACF` is basically **Auto Covariance** divaded by **Variance**.\n",
    "It is also known as `correlogram`. **ACF** is also normalized.\n",
    "If S<sub>t</sub> is correlated to S<sub>t-1</sub> this means it is **first order** dependency. Ideally we want S<sub>t</sub> to be strongly correlated to **first lag** and less and less with futher **lags**. **ACF** generally behaves likes correlation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "S<sub>t-1</sub> is `lag` of **order 1** of S<sub>t</sub>.\n",
    "- For example S<sub>t</sub> *= {1,2,3,4,5,...}* so basically **all data points**. <br>Then S<sub>t-1</sub> *= {2,3,4,5,6,...}* so all data points **expect first one**. It can be also written as S<sub>t-1</sub> = L(S<sub>t</sub>).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Auto Covariance` is calculated as: <br>\n",
    "*E[(S<sub>t</sub> - M<sub>t</sub>)(S<sub>t-1</sub> - M<sub>t-1</sub>)]*\n",

    "## Partial Auto Correlation Function \n",
    "\n",
    "`PACF` is conditional correlation. It takes out effect of all intermediate lags. It is useful in detecting order of **AR Process**.\n",

    "## Auto Regressive TIme Series Model\n",
    "\n",
    "`AR` model depends of **past values** and **error term**.\n",
    "**Stationary condition** matter a lot in **AR**. <br>\n",
    "**Non stationary** series will have **non declining** effect which is not a good thing. Without testing stationary you can't do estimation.\n"
